# Data-Analyst-Portfolio-1
Analyze data using SQL and Python then make data visualization using Tableau.

This project happen because I want to build a portfolio but I don't know where to start. Luckily I stumbled upon Alex The Analyst's YouTube channel (https://www.youtube.com/c/AlexTheAnalyst) so I gave it a go and Voila!!  I got my first project.

Thanks @AlexTheAnalyst You teach very well and are very easy to understand.
